# R code

This folder contains the necessary R code to replicate the spatial multivariate models and to reproduce the results obtained in the simulation study described in the paper.

The code to replicate the spatial multivariate models and the results obtained with German cancer data can be found [here](https://github.com/GaraziRetegui/A_new_approach_to_project_cancer_incidence_in_regions_without_population_based_cancer_registry/tree/main/R/Germany_data).
